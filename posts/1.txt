Week 1 - Background Research--
Introduction and background research for the project--
Sep 06 2016--

It’s the first week of many working on my Honours project, despite having done a multitude of large projects in the past, I can’t help but feel this is significantly more substantial and daunting. With that in mind this puts a lot of pressure on picking an interesting topic and emphasises the importance of picking a subject that truly inspires me. This would have been a problem for me in the past as I felt like I was equally interested in a broad range of subjects.--

However, I was fortunate enough to have an extremely proactive summer working in London with Cigital, a fantastic company specialising in software security. Throughout my time there I’ve met some of the brightest and inspiring people in the industry, learning an enormous amount from them in a seemingly short space of time. For the first time since I started University I feel like I have a sense of direction and know what I want to do once I finish my studies.--

With all that being said, I want to focus my dissertation project towards software security. To narrow that enormous field down, specifically something relating to teaching secure software development practices. After spending quite some time in academia and investing time outside of that into searching for methods to educate myself in secure coding practices, I feel that this is a vital pillar in software development that is often overlooked. After meeting with my lecturer I was advised to go and find some academic papers for guidance.--

I spent some time trying to find some valuable resources and I’ve included the papers that I felt could be useful resources for a literature review. This has helped give me a bit more of a sense of direction as the subject matter has an extremely broad range of studies. I’ll use this to give next week's post a bit more context for the project and invest some more time into developing an idea.--
