1.11 - Ethics & Risk assessment forms--
Going through some of the project formalities--
Nov 15 2016--


The past few weeks have been heavily focused on trying to move the project forward by practically implementing a solution based on the research performed weekly. This week is slightly different as there are still a few formalities to submit for the project, this includes a risk assessment and an ethical reviewal.--


<h4>
Risk Assessment
</h4>
<br>
This is defined as:--


<blockquote>
Risk is defined by reference to the potential physical or psychological harm, discomfort or stress that the research project might generate. You must consider if you are: working alone, in unsatisfactory working conditions, potential harassment situations, working in vulnerable situations, effect on participants and others, travel, etc.
</blockquote/>--


This is obviously extremely straight forward considering the nature of the project. As I’m solely working on the project and will be conducting the work exclusively within the University of Abertay this took all of 5 minutes to fill in.--




<h4>
Ethics Form
</h4>
<br>
This was significantly more time consuming than the risk assessment form, mainly because it’s actually somewhat relevant. Fortunately, the proposal form due prior to this submission provided an excellent template to answer most of the questions. However, most of the concepts were simplified as the audience is probably not technical. Overall, this was a good experience for managing and dealing with ethical concerns.
