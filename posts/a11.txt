Excellent evaluation of development styles and their effectiveness for educational software. Outlines caveats for the designs, stressing the importance of:--

<ul>
<li>Modular system design</li>
<li>User feedback driven development</li>
<li>Fits in with Agile based methodologies</li>
<li>Easy to use, robust and interactive</li>
</ul>--
